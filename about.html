        <br>
        I have spent most of my career so far doing freelancing work in TVC's, Cinematics and Games.
        <br>
        <br>
        I specialise in Houdini, which is where I usually do Modelling, 'General' FX, Character FX, Lighting/Rendering (Redshift/Vray), maybe more.
        I have never made an explosion.

        I graduated from RMIT's Bachelor of Design (Animation) in 2021.

        Software experience in order: Houdini, Blender, Maya, Redshift, After Effects, Nuke.
